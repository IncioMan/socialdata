Here's a [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36292959/pandas-merge-data-frames-on-datetime-index) which may help you. \n",

    ">   * **Hint 0**: The output from the classifier can be thought of as a probability that *in some precinct at some time* we will observe either a crime of type 1 or type 2. Since the two probabilities sum to 1, we can map this to a [color gradient](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html).  \n",
    ">   * **Hint 1**: You can use the method `predict_proba` from `sklearn` to output probabilities instead of classes from your decision tree classifier. This allows to use the map with a color gradient representing the probabilities of the crimes. \n",
    ">   *  **Hint 2**: Based on the data you feed to the Random Forest, you can use the average prediction of the all the datapoints you used for each specific district to create the visualization). \n",
    "> * Finally, create a GIF with all the maps you have drawn (from the 1st point) to display the entire week. To do so, first save each figure separatly and then load all the image and create a GIF. This can be done with `imageio` library in python. \n",
    ">   * **Hint 3**: Check out the following code to help with you (which assumes you've saved all files in a sub-directory called `Frames` with names `0.png`, `1.png`, ..., `167.png`, i.e. one frame per hour of the week)."
