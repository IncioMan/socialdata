1. Exploring the variable distribution (all municipalities aggregated)
- Errors + Cleaning
- Outliers (summary statistics, boxplots)
- Counting observations per each categorical variable (e.g. year, municipality, type of traffic) -barcharts
- Distribution of observations per each continuous variable (e.g avg. speed, percentage over limit, counted days) -histograms (Gaussian distribution qqplot?)

2. Data manipulation
- Counting the days (and apply log2?)
- Decide on focus-municipalities (most days/observations and diversity? 10-14)
- Decide on variables to plot
- Create new variables (e.g. ratio july/everyday, distance from speed limit)

3. Exploring the variable distribution (for some specific focus-municipalities) (normalizing to have percentage)
- Counting observations per each categorical variable (e.g. year, type of traffic) -barcharts
- Distribution of observations per each continuous variable (e.g. avg. speed, percentage over limit) -histograms (or boxplots?)

4. Exploring the temporal trend (x axis is YEAR) of some interesting variables (TBD) (all municipalities aggregated OR/AND focus-municipalities)
- Plot how some variables vary with years

5. Plot new variables (e.g. histogram of distance from speed limit, jitter plot of speed, boxplots?)

6. Evaluate histograms of avg.speed by long/lat
