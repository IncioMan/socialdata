Main idea:
    Explore driving behaviors of danes in different communes
    and try to explain these behvaiors by exploring possible correlation
    with social indicators

Why is it interesting:
    Traffic and accidents have a big impact on people's life and health
    Vejediraktoratet does already a lot of analysis of traffic data alone
    It could be interesting to identify external causes that influence the driving behaviors
    Social indexes are good indicators of the social structure of a municipality and could
    help understanding/predicting more about the traffic habits

Main goal: 
    Investigate the correlation between social indexes 
    and traffic behaviors in danish municipalities

Genre: 
  Annotated chart
Why:
  We want to place the chart in the center but still adding some information
  and keep a consistent visualization allowing the user to zoom in in the details
  without getting lost in different types of visualization
---
Elements:
  Kommuner data
  Traffic data
  Get kommuner shape files to plot
  Folium and maybe D3

Implementation plan:
  Pre process data (extract and clean)
  Statistical analysis of the 2 datasets
  Plotting data on maps
  Predict speeding patters for kommunes based on key indicators
---
Visualization:
  Predictions:
    Sliders for indicators and bar for prediction of fast drivers
    Map with points on map with predicted fast drivers using k-neighbors
